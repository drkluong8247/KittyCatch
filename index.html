<h2>Kitty Catcher</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Combining the ideas of collecting items and blasting enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The game is designed to be endless, with players attempting to shoot down enemies. However, enemies will gain strength as the game goes on.
The only way to deal with this is to power yourself up by grabbing collectibles. (This is currently capped, and generally results in easy gameplay or instant death.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Side-Scrolling Shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use the arrow keys to move, and the spacebar to shoot. Collect coins, avoid or shoot down enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
A basic side-scrolling game, with collection of items and enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Rather than have rare power-ups designed to increase the player's offensive powers, these will be replaced with collectibles that increase the player's abilities over time.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is set in a world centuries from now. Robots are a part of the community, people drive flying vehicles instead of cars, that sort of thing.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
An inventor has just finished creating his new storage system. On the outside, it looks like a normal box, but the inside is designed to be able to hold a lot more than it can appear to hold. It can fly, to make it easier to move than lifting it, has an eject button for easy removal of stored items, and even has a self-defense system to prevent theft. However, the inventor turns away for one second, when four stray kittens climb into the box, because kittens love boxes. Well apparently, that caused the box to get up and fly away, and now the inventor has lost his new invention. However, for you, and your three kitty friends, you get to enjoy a nice joyride in this high tech box. The self-defense system even gets stronger in proportion to the amount of stuff it holds, so you can grab coins, or even other kitten friends to join in on the fun! (Sorry, no kittens yet ;_;)
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This is meant for people who like to play side-scrolling shooter games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Potentially infinite time, depending on how the player plays. But generally, it will last about 2-5 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Don't neglect coins. They make fighting enemies a lot easier. Seriously, it seems easy at first, but gets ridiculous later.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
MS Paint was used to make the background, characters, attacks, and enemies from scratch.
I downloaded coin sound from freesound (plasterbrain)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Borrowed from the Phaser Example - Invaders to create the enemies and player controls.
